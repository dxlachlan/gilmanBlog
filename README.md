# gilmanBlog - a website + blog for my gilman project
‚Äª As a reciepient of the Benjamin A. Gilman Scholarship I must complete a scholarship project.

‚Äª This website along with two study abroad/gilman scholarship information sessions upon my return are the
basis of my project.

‚Äª Will be updating with various content throughout my stay and up to 6 months after the completion of my Fall 2016 semester.

‚ÄªAfter completing my Gilman Project and graduating from UNCC I intend to move back to Japan. After doing so I intend to upgrade this to a blog for future/potential english-speaking expats in Tokyo/Japan.
