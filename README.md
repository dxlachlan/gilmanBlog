# gilmanBlog - a website + blog for my gilman project

※As a recipient of the Benjamin A. Gilman Scholarship I must complete a scholarship project. This website along with two study abroad/Gilman Scholarship information sessions upon my return are the basis of my project.

※Will be updating with various content throughout my stay and up to 6 months after the completion of my Fall 2016 semester.

※After completing my Gilman Project and graduating from UNCC I intend to move back to Japan. After doing so I intend to upgrade this to a blog for future/potential English-speaking expats in Tokyo/Japan.
