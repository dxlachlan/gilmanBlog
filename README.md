# gilmanBlog - A website + blog for my gilman project
I was awarded the Benjamin A. Gilman Scholarship to study abroad for the Fall 2016 semester in Tokyo Japan. In order to receive the scholarship we must complete a project within 6 months of completing our program abroad. For my project I decided to build, manage, and run, a website/blog while abroad and to complete two information sessions on Study Abroad and the Gilman Scholarship upon return to UNC Charlotte.
