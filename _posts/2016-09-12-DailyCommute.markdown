<p>For my second video blog post I just spliced together a short clip showing what the ride is like on my daily commute to and from Fuchinobe Station to JF Oberlin. I'm still developing and fleshing out ideas for some future Video Blog update ideas. I have a few locational videos I'd like to shoot once I get the chance to get out and explore a bit more.</p>

<p>Getting to Machida Campus from the dorms (or from PFC campus) JF Oberlin offers a steady schedule of free buses running the majority of each day, everyday through the weekdays and part of saturdays. It's pretty convenient but you definitely need to make sure you arrive at the bus stop with plenty of time. Right around the time you'd expect to normally make the commute to campus in time for each period before lunch, the queue wraps all the way down to PFC Campus and back around the corner occassionally.
