<p>My entire study abroad experience would have not been possible in due support from the United States Department of State and the Benjamin A. Gilman Scholarship. This entire blog is one of three parts of my follow-on project that was completed within 6 months of my return from studying abroad in Machida, Japan.</p>

<p>This experience as a whole was life changing and has definitely altered the trajectory of both my professional and personal development for the better, and refined my focus to jump start my career, after graduation, in Japan.</p>
