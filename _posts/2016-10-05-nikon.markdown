<p>Short Locational VideoBlog from our trip to visit the Nikon Headquarters Museum in Shinagawa, Tokyo. The museum is small but definitely worth a trip if you're ever in the area in Tokyo. It's a bit hard to find as the Museum is hidden inside of a corporate building in Shinagawa, so it took me a little bit of searching to really find it.</p>
