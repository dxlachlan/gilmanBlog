<p>Asakusa is hands down one of my favorite places in Tokyo. When I visited in 2011, I absolutely fell in love with the place. Being in Japan for studies and living close to Tokyo, I was fortunate to be able to visit Asakusa a couple of times during this stay. Seeing as I was going to be leaving Japan in early January and didn't have much time left I needed to start trying to find stuff to bring back to America for friends and close families. So Misato and I made our way down to Asakusa to eat at one of our favorite Izakaya's and do some omiyage shopping. </p>
