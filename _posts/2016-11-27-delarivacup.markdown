<p>This weekend I competed in the 2016 De La Riva Cup at the Taito Sports Complex down near Asakusa. Back home I normally train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu multiple times a week as its one of my biggest hobbies. I had joined the Judo Club at JF Oberlin to help condition and try to pick up some new Judo/Tachiwaza techniques. While its helped condition me some, the conditioning isn't quite the same. I lost my first match in my Weight Division but I recognized my mistake and how I could control the matches to help cruise to the top and take 1st in the Absolute Division. The strategy I decided to employ actually worked and I won!</p>

<p>I got to hang out with Misato and Shoya at the tournment as Shoya also competed and Misato came to support me. I had been trying to eat fairly healthy before the tournament so Misato went out afterwards to celebrate at a local Izakaya. After we ate dinner we walked around in the rain sharing an umbrella at the Asakusa Sensoji Temple. Asakusa is definitely one of my favorite places in Tokyo, so I felt this weekend was definitely one of the best weekends I have had in Tokyo so far. Below are my individual matches from the 2016 - De La Riva Cup.</p>
