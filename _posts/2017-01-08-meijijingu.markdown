## New Years visit to Meiji Jingu

<p>After Asakusa, Meiji Jingu is probably one of the most absolute popular Shrines in all of Tokyo. It might even be more popular than Asakusa based on its location and close proximity to the popular Shibuya and Harajuku wards. New Years is probably the single most important holiday in Japan, at least during the duration of my stay it was definitely the most important holiday that passed. </p>

<p>Usually Japanese people spend their New Years Eve cleaning their house to go into the New Year with a metaphorical fresh start. Then after midnight or sometime after the new year has arrived they make their way to a shrine or temple for an important visit to declare and pray for goals they wish to accomplish. </p>

<p>Misato and I had visited a smaller shrine on New Years Day before Ohougatsu Dinner to make an important visit but had wanted to make a visit to a much more popular/bigger shrine so I could see the spectacle that goes on during the first few days of the year in Japan. I had been able to view a bit of New Year Shrine visits New Years eve when I had visited the Oji Inari Shrine but Meiji Jingu is definitely beautiful in it's own right.</p>
