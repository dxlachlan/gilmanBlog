<p>This week was pretty busy with various things going on both socially and for school. I was able to find time, however, to head down to Roppongi on Wednesday to visit the Snoopy Museum. This had been an objective of mine ever since I saw an ad for the museum in Machida a few weeks ago. I apparently wasn't supposed to be filming or taking pictures inside of the museum but here you go.</p>
