<p>The month of October has been an exciting and extremely busy month, especially in the last two weeks. This past week has been extremely busy and stressful as I prep for my midterms so I haven't been able to put in as much time filming. So this update is a little bit of a collage of various moments I was able to have my camera on me to capture in my weekly commute and various activities. I promise my video updates will get better in the near</p>
