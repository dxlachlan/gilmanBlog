## Introduction 
<br>
<p>This blog was started as a part of my requirement for my Benjamin A. Gilman Scholarship follow-on project idea. I was awarded the Gilman Scholarship to study abroad for the Fall 2016 semester in Tokyo, Japan at J.F. Oberlin University. I will be updating this post as I complete the migration of my blog and it's contents from its older setup to the new setup and design.</p>

## Hugo to Jekyll

When originally designing my site I was looking for a framework to help make the general development a bit easier to maintain and update. Looking through various Content Management Systems (CMS), I came across static site generators (SSG) as a CMS. Among the top rated SSGs, Hugo was among the top few SSG's available. Working with Hugo was definitely enjoyable but the most heavily used and documented SSG was Jekyll. 

As one of my goals with this scholarship project was to create a platform I could potentially use in the future for a blog after I return to Japan to document living in Japan, I wanted something a bit more fully established and with Jekyll there were a few already well developed "themes" that I could utilize to minimize work involved in the user interface side of things. Just employ some tweaks to the CSS/SASS and minor adjustments to the HTML until I could develop something a bit more unique.

## GitPages to Netlify

Initially my page was hosted on GitPages which was convenient. I had it set up with Wercker so that with every commit it would automatically deploy live from the repository to my GitPages site. Since I wanted to repurpose my GitPages to actually host something related to my development work, I began looking for something for dedicated hosting for my Gilman Project Website. I saw Netlify was offering dedicated hosting and had fairly streamlined process to connected the git repo with the files to Netlify and decided to migrate my development process to Netlify. Since then it's offered me a similar process of deployment automative.
