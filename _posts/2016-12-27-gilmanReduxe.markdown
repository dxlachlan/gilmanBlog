## Introduction 

This blog was started as a part of my requirement for my Benjamin A. Gilman Scholarship follow-on project idea. I was awarded the Gilman Scholarship to study abroad for the Fall 2016 semester in Tokyo, Japan at J.F. Oberlin University. I will be updating this post as I complete the migration of my blog and it's contents from its older setup to the new setup and design. 

## Hugo to Jekyll

## GitPages to Netlify

## Misc
