<p>My time in Japan is starting to draw near to an end which is kind of sad. I've been spending alot of my free time hanging out with Misato which has been pretty awesome. Having conversations with her have moslty been in Japanese which has been forcing my spoken Japanese to constantly improve, probably well beyond my written/reading ability. She wanted to introduce me to her Mother so we met her Mom for dinner in Sakuragichou down in Yokohama. After eating dinner we went out for a bit and I finally got to ride the Cosmo Clock, which is a kind of iconic structure for Yokohama. </p>
